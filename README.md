This is a Group project and you are expected to work effectively with people in your group.
Objective:
Develop a basic library management system that allows users to:
Add books (including title, author, ISBN, publication year, and availability status)
Search for books by title, author, or ISBN
Borrow books (updating availability status)
Return books (updating availability status)
View a list of available books
Save and load book data from/to a file
Download the handout from AutoLabLinks to an external site. and implement the methods in the Library class.  Once you are done, submit a tar file of Book.java and Library.java to AutoLab.  NOTE: Currently AutoLab will not run any tests. This assignment will be manually graded by me. Only one person per group needs to submit the assignment.
You should also submit a project report which should include:
Evidence of group collaboration (screenshots of discord chats, emails etc.)
A brief description of how you have solved the problem (what data structures you used and why)
Big-O analysis of the key methods.
Concepts that you will need to use:
This project will require you to use several different data structures and File I/O concepts. NOTE: You do NOT need to implement all the data structures. You can use the datastructures that come as part of the Java Development Kit (in java.util package). Choose the data structure that makes the most sense to optimize for the specific operations.
Project Decomposition:
One or two members can focus on implementing adding and removing books from the library.
One or two members can implement the code to search for books and borrow/return books to the library.
Some group members can implement writing the library contents to a file and reading it back. They can choose a suitable file format (e.g., CSV, JSON) and implement functions to parse and serialize the book data.
Testing and Integration:
Once the individual components are implemented, the group can collaborate to test each component thoroughly and integrate them into a cohesive system.
Additional Considerations:
Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid user input or exceptions that may occur during file operations.
Efficiency: Consider the efficiency of your data structures and algorithms, especially for searching and sorting large numbers of books.
Modularity: Design the code to be modular and well-organized, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.
Documentation: Document your code using comments. Also include Big-O analysis of the various methods in the Library class.
Unknown Requirements: Like in the real world, not everything is completely specified. Make appropriate assumptions and document them in your report and the code. Reach out to the instructor in case you want further clarity.
By following this approach, your group can effectively divide the workload, leverage each member's strengths, and create a robust and well-structured library management system.
